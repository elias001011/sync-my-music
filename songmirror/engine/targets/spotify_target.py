"""Spotify as a writable mirror peer (N-way sync only).

In one-way mode Spotify is just the source and this target isn't built. In
N-way mode it becomes a first-class peer: the same reconcile that edits Apple
and YouTube Music also adds/removes on Spotify. Reads reuse the helpers in
spotify.py; writes go through spotipy's playlist-modify endpoints and therefore
need the modify scopes (see spotify.client(writable=True)).
