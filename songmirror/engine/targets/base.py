    Canonical precedence: direct/provider-native ISRC -> explicit reverse link

    identity this same entry earned on an earlier pass -> track_key.
    Getting the same song onto ONE canonical id across providers is the crux, so
    ISRC is pulled from wherever each provider exposes it: Spotify carries it
    inline; Apple's ISRC resolve cache maps catalog_id -> ISRC; and key2isrc
    (built from this playlist's Spotify tracks) rescues any remaining track whose
    fuzzy key already exists on Spotify. Without it, an ISRC-less YT copy of a
    Spotify song splits into a duplicate.

    The remembered identity is what makes a physical entry's id STICKY. Every
    softer step above reads provider metadata, and that metadata is mutable:
    YouTube's youtubei playlist read alternates, for one unchanging video,
    between the track's artist and its auto-generated "<artist> - Topic" channel,
    sometimes the generic "Release - Topic", which names no artist at all. Each
    flip re-keys the entry from its ISRC down to a fuzzy key, which the merge
    cannot tell apart from the user deleting the song. A provider-proven hard id
    computed now wins and refreshes the memory, so a wrong binding self-corrects
    on the next good read. Same-playlist key inference may seed an unbound entry
