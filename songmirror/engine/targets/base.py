    Canonical precedence: ISRC (direct / provider-native map / same-playlist
    Spotify track_key) -> ISRC via the reverse link to Spotify -> the Spotify id
    -> the identity this same entry earned on an earlier pass -> track_key.
    Getting the same song onto ONE canonical id across providers is the crux, so

    (built from this playlist's Spotify tracks) rescues any remaining track whose
    fuzzy key already exists on Spotify. Without it, an ISRC-less YT copy of a
    Spotify song splits into a duplicate.

    The remembered identity is what makes a physical entry's id STICKY. Every
    softer step above reads provider metadata, and that metadata is mutable:
    YouTube's youtubei playlist read alternates, for one unchanging video,
    between the track's artist and its auto-generated "<artist> - Topic" channel,
    sometimes the generic "Release - Topic", which names no artist at all. Each
    flip re-keys the entry from its ISRC down to a fuzzy key, which the merge
    cannot tell apart from the user deleting the song. A hard id computed now
    always wins and refreshes the memory, so a wrong binding self-corrects on the
