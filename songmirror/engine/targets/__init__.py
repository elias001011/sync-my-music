"""Mirror targets: the services a playlist is mirrored across.

Adding a provider (Deezer, Tidal, …) is deliberately local:
  1. Write `targets/<svc>.py` with a `MirrorTarget` subclass implementing the
     ~8 methods (see base.py). Carry ISRC in `playlist_tracks` if the API has
     it — that's what makes cross-provider matching reliable and free.
  2. Add one line to `_REGISTRY` below: `source -> builder(opts, sp) -> target|None`.
Everything else — one-way mirroring, N-way reconcile, canonical identity,
caching, safety rails — is provider-agnostic and needs no change.
