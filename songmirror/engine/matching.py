"""Track identity and matching.

The hierarchy every cross-service music tool uses: a hard identifier (ISRC or a
cached link) first, then a fuzzy search scored against title/artist/duration.
The fuzzy layer is RapidFuzz `token_set_ratio` (order/subset/decoration
tolerant) plus Jaro-Winkler (short strings, transliteration near-misses), run
over both raw and romanized (anyascii) variants so different scripts match. The
duration anchor gates the looser matching so a different version or a
wrong-artist cover is rejected when its length disagrees.
