"""EventBus — fan-out of engine log events to SSE subscribers.

The engine emits `logs.Event`s from *worker threads* (one-way passes run one
thread per target). `asyncio.Queue` is not thread-safe, so every publish is
marshalled onto the event loop with `call_soon_threadsafe`. A small ring buffer
lets a late/reconnecting browser backfill the current pass.

Services tier: it imports the leaf `logs` module (never the reverse).
