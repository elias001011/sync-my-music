"""Named sync jobs — multiple independent sync configurations (Soundiiz-style).

Each job is a self-contained sync config: a name, on/off, direction, one-way
source of truth, participating providers, playlist filter, safety caps, and its
OWN auto-sync interval. The download mirror stays global (SettingsStore's
DOWNLOAD_DIR/LOCAL_MIRROR_FORMAT) — a job just opts in via `download`.

Persisted to data/syncs.json (owner-only) alongside the other data-dir state.
The engine is unchanged: SyncService builds an Options per job and runs it, so
each job is an ordinary pass.
