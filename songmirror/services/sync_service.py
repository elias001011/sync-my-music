"""SyncService — the single serialization point for every engine invocation.

Runs multiple named sync jobs (SyncStore), each with its own auto-sync interval,
plus on-demand ("run now") passes. Exactly one pass runs at a time — a shared
lock serializes jobs AND transfers, because the engine's on-disk resolve caches
and shared SQLite are not safe under concurrent writers.

Scheduling is per-job: each enabled job fires on wall-clock boundaries (epoch
multiples of its interval, e.g. 3h -> 00:00/03:00/06:00 UTC), so the cadence
survives restarts instead of resetting to "interval after boot". All timers are
gated by a global master switch (AUTO_SYNC — the Dashboard toggle). The download mirror is global
(SettingsStore) and a job opts in via `job.download`. Passes run in a worker
thread so the event loop stays responsive; lifecycle events reach the live view
through the EventBus.
