# Sync My Music

Self-hosted music database, cross-service playlist synchronization and unified listening recaps. Built for a private machine or Termux server and optionally reachable only on your home LAN.

**Canonical library · playlist version history · manual/automatic syncs · Musify export · Sonora backup/P2P bridge · consolidated recaps · persistent logs**

> This project is an MIT-licensed adaptation of [SongMirror](https://github.com/ahnafnafee/songmirror). Its mature playlist matching and synchronization engine remains the foundation; the canonical database, recap ingestion, Musify/Sonora surfaces and LAN bridge are maintained here.

See [the architecture and synchronization model](docs/architecture.md) for the distinction between the canonical database, provider mirrors, event scrobbles and replaceable recap snapshots.

## ✨ Features

SongMirror keeps your playlists identical everywhere without manual re-adding, one-by-one copying, or a paid cloud service holding your library. It is **cross-platform, self-hosted, and open source**.

- 🔁 **True mirroring, not append-only** — adds _and_ removals. Choose a source of truth (Spotify by default) and the others follow it.
- ⇄ **Bidirectional N-way sync** — an add or removal on _any_ connected service propagates to all the others, echo-free, behind removal guards.
- 🎯 **ISRC-accurate matching** — exact recording identity where available, with Unicode-aware fuzzy title/artist/duration fallbacks (feat-credit drift, "- 2015 Remaster" suffixes, non-Latin scripts, video-only uploads — all handled).
- 🎛️ **Multiple named syncs** — set up as many independent syncs as you like, each with its own services, playlists, schedule, and safety caps.
- ↪️ **One-off transfers** — copy any playlist from one service to another with a live progress bar; **pause, resume, or stop** mid-copy, and manually resolve unmatched tracks.
- 🌐 **Followed playlists** — sync and transfer playlists you follow but don't own, not just ones you created.
- 💿 **Local download mirror** — keep offline audio, one folder per playlist in **Jellyfin's** `AlbumArtist/Album` layout, with covers and an auto-updated `.m3u8`.
- 🛡️ **Safety rails** — dry-run by default, per-pass add/removal caps, net-loss protection, empty-snapshot guard, fail-closed on expired tokens.
- 🗃️ **Ever-growing song archive** — every track ever seen is recorded in a local SQLite database (name, artist, album, ISRC, raw metadata, first/last seen).
- 🐳 **Runs anywhere** — one `docker compose up -d` for the browser app, or plain CLI + cron / Task Scheduler.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Self-hosted and private by design.** Your listening data and credentials never leave your machine. The web UI has **no login** — bind it to your LAN and don't port-forward it to the internet.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The fastest way to run it is Docker — the container serves the web UI and runs your syncs on schedule.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elias001011/sync-my-music.git
cd sync-my-music
docker compose up -d
```

Then open **`http://localhost:8888`** and connect your services in the browser. That's it — **no `.env` to edit**; everything is configured in the UI and saved under `./data`.

Prefer running it without Docker?

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn songmirror.web:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
# this machine: http://127.0.0.1:8080
# home LAN:     http://<server-ip>:8080
```

> Requires [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python 3.13+). Do not forward this port to the public internet. The Sonora LAN bridge is disabled until you enable it under Accounts.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 🐳 Always running: Docker

The Docker container is the recommended deployment: it serves the web UI, runs your syncs on their schedules, and restarts with the host. It runs as **`songmirror`** and persists all auth + caches in `./data`.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build     # build + start in the background
# open http://<host>:8888 and connect your services + create syncs in the browser
docker compose logs -f           # watch it work
```

**No `.env` is needed to start** — everything is configured in the browser and saved under `./data`. OAuth, partner-token, and API-key setup all live on the Accounts page; each wizard explains the service-specific prerequisites and exact callback URI. Then build your syncs on the Sync page.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Port** | The UI is published on host **8888** (the `8888:8080` mapping in `docker-compose.yml`; change the host side if it clashes). **LAN-only** — don't port-forward it to the internet; the UI has no login yet. |
| **Persistence** | `./data` holds credentials, tokens, caches, and the song archive. Back it up to keep your setup across rebuilds. |
| **Downloads** | Set `DOWNLOAD_DIR` (in `.env` or your shell) to your host music dir (e.g. `F:\Torrent\Music`); compose bind-mounts it to `/music`. From Docker, set `JELLYFIN_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:8096`. |
| **Expired sessions** | Renewable sessions recover on the next scheduled or manual pass. TIDAL web, Qobuz, and Apple Music tokens must be re-pasted on the Accounts page when rejected; no restart is needed. |

## ⚙️ How it works

Every pass, for each selected playlist name that exists on the source:

1. Snapshot the source playlist (tracks, ISRCs, added-at dates).
2. Reconcile the same-named playlist on every selected, connected target concurrently through that service's account-authorized playlist API.
3. Missing tracks are resolved (cached links → ISRC → scored search) and appended oldest-first; tracks gone from the source are removed behind guards.
4. Optionally, [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) syncs a local audio folder per playlist.

The default source of truth is Spotify, but **one-way mode is provider-agnostic** — any connected playlist peer can be the source instead.

### Matching

Same hierarchy the cross-service tools use ([TuneLink](https://tommcfarlin.com/case-study-tunelink-matching-music-ai/), MusicBrainz): **hard identifier → search → fuzzy score**.

1. **Cached link** — once a source track is matched to a target's catalog id / video id, that link is stored and reused (immune to title drift).
2. **ISRC** — exact recording identity where the service exposes it.
3. **Scored search** — [RapidFuzz](https://rapidfuzz.com/) `token_set_ratio` + Jaro-Winkler, over both the raw and **romanized** ([anyascii](https://github.com/anyascii/anyascii)) title and artist, anchored by duration. This handles, without hardcoding:
   - **Multi-artist credits** — one service lists every feature, another lists the primary (`Arijit Singh, Ved Sharma, …` ↔ `Arijit Singh`).
   - **Title decoration** — `(feat. …)`, `- 2015 Remaster`, `(From "…")`, extra "Official Music Video" suffixes.
   - **Transliteration** — Cyrillic / Bengali / Greek / Arabic (`Камин` ↔ `Kamin`, `নেশার বোঝা` ↔ `Neshar Bojha`).
   - **Video-only tracks** — YouTube search falls back to the `videos` filter for indie/OST tracks that live on YT only as uploads.

The **duration anchor** unlocks the looser title match, so a different version (`Runaway - Piano Version`) or a wrong-artist cover isn't accepted when its length disagrees. Tracks with no confident match are reported and skipped.

### Bidirectional (N-way) sync

By default one provider is the source of truth and edits flow one way. In **N-way mode** every selected provider is a peer: add or remove a track on any one and the change propagates to the others.

Bidirectional sync is impossible statelessly, so each logical playlist's canonical membership is snapshotted after every clean pass. Each pass diffs every provider against that snapshot, unions the changes, and reconciles everyone to the result:

- **Echo-free** — a propagated add becomes part of the snapshot, so it's never bounced back.
- **Add-wins** on conflict — losing a song is worse than keeping an extra one.
- **Read-collapse guard** — if a provider suddenly reads far fewer tracks than the baseline (a transient API hiccup), it's skipped that pass so one bad read can't cascade a mass-delete.
- **Same rails as one-way** — per-pass `MAX_ADDS` / `MAX_REMOVALS` caps and net-loss protection hold on every write side.
- **Removals are opt-in** — `MAX_REMOVALS` defaults to 0, so a track that disappears from one provider (deleted there, or silently pulled by licensing) is kept on the others and only logged. Set a cap (or the UI's "Mirror removals" toggle) to propagate deletions.

> **Always dry-run first.** Run without `--execute` (or use **Preview** in the UI) and read the plan — it prints every proposed add/remove on every provider before anything is written.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 💿 Local download mirror (Jellyfin)

Keep an offline audio copy of each synced playlist, one folder per playlist, via [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader). Sync is true mirroring: new tracks are downloaded, removed tracks are deleted locally. The layout is **Jellyfin-ready** — point a Jellyfin music library at the download dir and both the tracks and the playlists appear, staying updated every pass:

```text
<DOWNLOAD_DIR>/
  <Playlist>/
    <Playlist>.m3u8          # auto-(re)generated; Jellyfin imports it as a playlist
    cover.jpg                # the source playlist cover, highest resolution
    <AlbumArtist>/
      <Album>/
        Artists - Title.mp3  # tagged + cover art embedded
```

Enable it by setting `DOWNLOAD_DIR` and installing spotDL + ffmpeg:

```bash
uv tool install spotdl       # isolated CLI; or: pipx install spotdl
# ffmpeg required: winget install ffmpeg   (or: spotdl --download-ffmpeg)
```

- **Incremental** — after the first full download, only newly-added tracks are fetched; removed tracks (and their emptied album folders) are pruned. An interrupted run continues next pass.
- **Newest-first `.m3u8`** — written in date-added order, newest at the top (set `LOCAL_MIRROR_ORDER=oldest` to flip). Rebuild covers / tags / mtimes from existing files with `uv run main.py --refresh-local`.
- **Playlist covers in Jellyfin** — Jellyfin ignores a cover file next to an m3u, so set `JELLYFIN_URL` + `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` and each pass uploads the real playlist cover via the Jellyfin API.
- **Audio quality** — the source is YouTube, so without a YT Music **Premium** cookie the ceiling is ~128–160 kbps. `LOCAL_MIRROR_FORMAT=opus` keeps YouTube's native stream without an mp3 re-encode; a Premium cookie (`LOCAL_MIRROR_COOKIE_FILE`) unlocks 256 kbps AAC. Selecting `flac` changes the output container but cannot turn a lossy source into lossless audio.

Monochrome's current FLAC path uses browser-gated, single-use playback resources rather than a stable, provider-authorized file-export API, so SongMirror does not automate it. Use the local mirror only for content you own or are otherwise authorized to copy.

## 🔌 Connecting each service

In the web app, the **Accounts** page walks you through each service and shows the exact values to paste. Nothing is proxied through a third party.

### Credential renewal

SongMirror refreshes credentials **just in time**, not with a separate token-refresh timer. Every manual or scheduled sync pass validates the connectors it uses and renews supported access tokens before the first request (or once after an authentication rejection). It is normal for a short-lived access token to expire between passes—the durable refresh token or renewal cookie is what matters. The Accounts page validates status when it loads or regains focus, but it is not the background keep-alive; enabled sync schedules are.

| Service | Renewal behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Spotify** | OAuth access tokens refresh automatically from the saved refresh token when a client is built. Cookie mode mints a web access token from the saved `sp_dc` cookie on demand and retries with a new token after a `401`; the underlying cookie can still be revoked. |
| **TIDAL** | A pasted web-player Bearer cannot be renewed and must be captured again after expiry. The optional developer OAuth fallback refreshes automatically when a refresh token is available. |
| **Qobuz** | The pasted `X-User-Auth-Token` is used until Qobuz rejects it, then must be captured again. |
| **Deezer** | The short-lived Pipe JWT renews automatically from the saved `refresh-token` before use and once after a `401/403`; rotated renewal state is persisted. |
| **Amazon Music** | The web access token renews from the allowlisted signed-in browser cookies shortly before known expiry and once after a `401/403`; refreshed device context and rotated cookies are persisted. Logout, security changes, or server-side revocation still require a fresh capture. |
| **Apple Music** | The pasted Bearer and Media-User-Token cannot be renewed by SongMirror and must be captured again after rejection. |
| **YouTube Music** | Data API OAuth refreshes automatically within 60 seconds of expiry. Browser mode attempts Google's cookie rotation whenever a sync target is built; an already-expired browser session must be exported again. |
| **Jellyfin** | The API key has no access-token refresh cycle; replace it only if it is revoked or deleted. |

### Spotify

1. Create an app at <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard> and copy its **Client ID** + **Client Secret**.
2. Add a redirect URI — the connect wizard shows the exact one, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8888/oauth/spotify/callback` (Docker) or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth/spotify/callback` (direct run). Spotify only allows an `http` redirect on the loopback IP, so authorize via `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, not a LAN IP.

The web UI requests read + write scopes up front (Spotify is a write target in N-way syncs and reverse transfers). The CLI reads Spotify read-only in one-way mode.

### TIDAL

Sign in at <https://listen.tidal.com>, open DevTools → **Network**, open a playlist, and filter for `openapi.tidal.com/v2`. Copy a request's headers (or copy it as cURL) into the wizard. SongMirror keeps only the Bearer token and two-letter catalog country. An existing developer OAuth token remains supported as an environment fallback.

Only catalog metadata and the signed-in user's playlists are used; playback assets are outside this integration. Browser tokens are short-lived, so re-paste when the account reports **Expired**.

### Qobuz

Sign in at <https://play.qobuz.com>, open DevTools → **Network**, and filter for `api.json/0.2`. Choose any request containing `X-App-Id` and `X-User-Auth-Token`—including an authenticated `album/story` request—then copy its request headers or copy it as cURL and paste it into the wizard. SongMirror persists only those two values, sends them using the same header-based flow as the web player, and discards cookies and unrelated browser metadata. No business API approval or user id is required; existing partner credentials remain a compatible environment fallback.

The adapter uses catalog search and playlist endpoints only—it does not request stream or file URLs.

### Deezer

Sign in at <https://www.deezer.com>, open DevTools → **Network**, and reload the page. Filter for `auth.deezer.com/login/renew`, copy that request's headers (or copy it as cURL), and paste it into the renewal field. Firefox may instead copy the request cookies as a bare semicolon-delimited block; that shape is accepted too. SongMirror retains only the dedicated `refresh-token` cookie and uses it to renew Deezer's short-lived Pipe JWT automatically. You may also paste a current `pipe.deezer.com/api` request as an immediate bootstrap, but it is not required when renewal is configured. Playlist additions and removals both use the renewable Pipe session; no `arl` cookie is needed. Existing developer OAuth tokens remain a compatible environment fallback.

### Amazon Music

No developer approval is required for the default connector. It uses the same authenticated GraphQL and token-renewal routes as the Amazon Music web player:

1. Sign in at <https://music.amazon.com> and open DevTools → **Network**.
2. Reload the page, filter for `config.json`, and select the signed-in request. (`pandaToken` works too when it appears, but it is not required.)
3. Choose **Copy request headers** or **Copy as cURL**, then paste it into the renewal field.
4. Optionally copy the signed-in `config.json` **Response** into the bootstrap field; SongMirror can normally fetch that device context using the renewal session.

SongMirror derives the same `AmznMusic` authorization value locally and refreshes it through `music.amazon.com/pandaToken` before expiry or once after an authentication rejection. It stores only a named allowlist of Amazon authentication/session cookies plus limited Music-client device context; analytics, experiment, AWS-console, CSRF, and other unrelated browser data are discarded. Those retained cookies are still sensitive, so keep SongMirror private on your LAN. A logout, password/security change, or Amazon-side revocation can still require one fresh capture.

This is an unsupported first-party web-client interface and Amazon can change it without notice. The documented [Amazon Music Web API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/music/API_web_overview.html) is still a closed beta; approved partner credentials remain an optional fallback when configured through environment variables.

### Apple Music

No Apple Developer account needed — two headers from `music.apple.com` are enough. Open <https://music.apple.com>, sign in, open DevTools → **Network**, play a song, filter for `amp-api.music.apple.com`, and from any request's headers copy:

- `authorization: Bearer eyJ...` → **Bearer token** (the `eyJ...` part, without `Bearer `)
- `media-user-token: ...` → **User token** (full value)

The connect wizard lets you paste the raw headers and parses the values for you. Tokens last months; re-paste them on the Accounts page when they expire.

### YouTube Music

Talks to the **official [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)**, whose OAuth refresh token is durable and survives restarts.

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), create a project, enable **YouTube Data API v3**, and create an OAuth client of type **TVs and Limited Input devices**.
2. On the **OAuth consent screen**, set **Publishing status → In production** (leaving it in "Testing" expires the token after 7 days).
3. In the app, paste the client ID + secret and complete the on-screen device code.

> **Quota**: the Data API allows 10,000 units/day (a search costs 100, an add/remove 50). Steady-state upkeep is cheap; a big first-time backlog can hit the cap and resume the next day.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 🖥️ Headless CLI

Prefer `.env` + cron / Task Scheduler? The same engine runs headless.

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env            # fill in credentials
uv run main.py                  # dry run — prints every add/remove it *would* do
uv run main.py --execute        # apply for real
```

Useful flags:

```bash
uv run main.py --execute --playlists "Aurora,Chill"   # only these pairs
uv run main.py --execute --loop --interval 15m        # run forever
uv run main.py --execute --max-removals 100           # one-off larger cleanup
```

Key env vars (see `.env.example`): the credentials for whichever providers you use, `PLAYLISTS`, `SYNC_INTERVAL`, `MAX_ADDS` / `MAX_REMOVALS`, `DOWNLOAD_DIR`, `SYNC_MODE=nway`, and `PROVIDERS`.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 🛡️ Safety rails

Removals are destructive, so they're guarded:

- **Dry run is the default** — nothing changes without `--execute` (or the UI's real-sync action).
- If the source returns 0 tracks for a playlist the target shows as non-empty, removals are skipped that pass (a transient API failure can't empty a playlist).
- **Removals are off by default** — `MAX_REMOVALS=0` holds every removal back (logged, never applied), so a licensing takedown on one platform can't cascade a deletion to the rest. Opt in per sync with the "Mirror removals" toggle (or set `MAX_REMOVALS`), and even then more pending removals than the cap in one pass → all skipped and logged.
- More than `MAX_ADDS` pending additions → the rest continue next pass (giant one-burst backfills are what trip bot detection).
- **Net-loss protection** — a target-side track resembling a source track that has no match on that service is held, not deleted.
- Any provider authentication failure aborts that provider's pass immediately — no partial deletes on expired tokens.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 🗃️ Caching &amp; song archive

Everything resolvable is cached so steady-state passes are near-instant: per-service resolve caches (ISRC + search, including misses), a `snapshot_id`-keyed track-list cache, hard identifier links in SQLite, and a per-pair snapshot-skip (`unchanged since last clean sync`).

Every pass also archives the metadata of every track it sees into `song_cache.db` — a SQLite file that only ever grows. Removed tracks stay archived with name, artist, album, duration, ISRC, raw snapshot JSON, and first/last-seen timestamps:

```bash
sqlite3 song_cache.db "SELECT name, artist, album, first_seen FROM songs ORDER BY first_seen DESC LIMIT 20"
```

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 🧱 Project layout

CLI entry: `uv run main.py` (thin shim) or `python -m songmirror`. Web entry: `songmirror.web:app`.

```text
songmirror/
  engine/       # provider-agnostic sync core (no web deps): runner, matching, targets/, spotify, downloads, archive
  services/     # stateful services over the engine: accounts/ connectors, syncs, sync_service, transfers, playlists, settings
  web/          # FastAPI app: thin HTTP/SSE over services/ (routers/)
frontend/       # React + Vite SPA (built and served by the API in production)
```

**Adding another service**: subclass `MirrorTarget`, implement ~8 methods, add its builder to `engine/targets`' `_REGISTRY`, and add a matching `Connector` under `services/accounts`. All reconciliation — diff, ordering, safety rails, logging, snapshot-skip — is inherited.

<div align="right">

[![][back-to-top]](#readme-top)

</div>

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

- **`Missing required environment variable`** — fill in `.env` (CLI) or connect the service in the UI.
- **TIDAL, Qobuz, or Apple reports `Expired` / `401` / `403`** — these pasted sessions have no renewable secret; capture a fresh signed-in request or token in Accounts.
- **Deezer renewal fails** — capture a fresh `auth.deezer.com/login/renew` request (or its `refresh-token` cookie). A current Pipe Bearer alone is only a temporary bootstrap.
- **Amazon Music renewal fails** — capture a fresh signed-in `config.json` request. The response JSON is optional; the request's allowlisted authentication cookies are the durable renewal material.
- **YouTube Music browser mode expires** — export fresh browser request headers. For the most durable unattended setup, use Data API OAuth with an in-production consent screen.
- **Spotify OAuth redirect mismatch** — the redirect URI in your Spotify app must exactly match the one the wizard shows (including the port).
- **A playlist isn't syncing** — confirm it's in the sync's playlist scope and exists on the source (targets are auto-created on a real pass).
